# CHANGELOG

## v. 0.1.0-ALPHA

* New commands:
    * `!addmoney name amt` - adds `amt` to `name`'s personal funds 
    * `!spendmoney name amt` - removes `amt` from `name`'s personal funds
    * `!describe name` - The next message from that user will set a description for `name`. 
    If the user sends `!cancel` instead of a description, no change is made.
